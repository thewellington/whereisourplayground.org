      <p>This community center was once a vibrant place for our city's youth to participate in numerous programs that kept them out of trouble.  One only need view the vandalism that has occurred in and around this now empty and desolate building to see what trouble kids are up to now.</p>

      <p>Now three years and several "delays" later one must ask the question, is Seattle Parks being run in an efficient and effective manner?  How are our taxpayer dollars being spent?  How do we trust the word of Seattle Parks again?</p>

		<li><strong>Monitor the City's project page:</strong> <a href="{{ page.parks-dept.link }}" target="_blank">{{ page.parks-dept.link }}</a></li>
		<li><strong>Contact {{ page.parks-dept.name }}</strong> at Seattle Parks.  Ask for a <mark>project update</mark> and a <mark>full accounting of the project's delays.</mark>  They can be reached by email at <a href="mailto:{{ page.parks-dept.email }}">{{ page.parks-dept.email }}</a> or by phone at <a href="tel:+1{{ page.parks-dept.phone }}">{{ page.parks-dept.phone }}</a></li>
		<li><strong>Contact Councilmember Lisa Herbold.</strong>  Ask her when Parks will complete the Community Center project.  Council Member Herbold's contact info is here: <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/council/herbold" target="_blank">https://www.seattle.gov/council/herbold</a>

      <p>It has been over two years since Seattle Parks closed Westcrest Play Area citing safety issues.  Each time Parks provides communication regarding this project it is only to delay construction another six months to a year.  Here we are now six updates later and we seem no closer to breaking ground on the promised play area replacement.</p>

      <p>It begs the question, is Seattle Parks being run in an efficient and effective manner?  How are our taxpayer dollars being spent?  How do we trust the word of Seattle Parks again?</p>

Weâ€™ve adjusted to a strategy of including this work as part of a larger bid package. A new (to this project) project manager has been assigned and I have requested that they keep you up to date when they have a more firm timeline."</li>

        <p>Seattle Parks is not a very responsive organization.  In fairness they are understaffed and underfunded like every other part of our city.  If you want change, you are going to have to work at it.  Here are some things you can do to help.
        
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Monitor the City's project page:</strong> <a href="{{ page.parks-dept.link }}" target="_blank">{{ page.parks-dept.link }}</a></li>
        <li><strong>Contact {{ page.parks-dept.name }}</strong> at Seattle Parks.  Ask for a <mark>project update</mark> and a <mark>full accounting of the project's delays.</mark>  They can be reached by email at <a href="mailto:{{ page.parks-dept.email }}">{{ page.parks-dept.email }}</a> or by phone at <a href="tel:+1{{ page.parks-dept.phone }}">{{ page.parks-dept.phone }}</a></li>
        <li><strong>Contact Councilmember Lisa Herbold.</strong>  Ask her when Parks will complete the Community Center project.  Council Member Herbold's contact info is here: <a href="https://www.seattle.gov/council/herbold" target="_blank">https://www.seattle.gov/council/herbold</a><li>

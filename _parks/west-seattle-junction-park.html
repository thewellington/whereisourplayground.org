  <p class="lead">Seattle Parks and Recreation purchased .38 acres in 2012 to provide the community access to open space within high density urban areas across the city. The Seattle Park District funds the development of this parcel into a park. The design will incorporate accessibility in compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and additional park elements will be incorporated after gathering public input.

      <blockquote class="blockquote">"In the summer of 2020, the City of Seattle turned its focus to essential functions to address the pandemic and economic crisis, which required a significant reprioritization of resources. After careful analysis of equity considerations, health and safety concerns, and alignment with essential functions, Seattle Parks and Recreation (SPR) suspended many capital projects including the West Seattle Junction Park Development project. As promised at the time, SPR worked to restore funding in future budget cycles for suspended projects. In September 2022, the Seattle City Council, acting in their role as Seattle Park District Board, passed a new six-year funding plan for the 2023-2028 Park District cycle which includes funding for this project and many more. SPR staff are now reprioritizing projects in this six-year funding plan using several criteria, including equity, and creating a plan for implementation. We anticipate having a plan in the second quarter of 2023 that will guide our Park District capital work over the next six years. We will update the schedule below when we have the workplan completed."<blockquote>

      <p>This play area is a vibrant center of our community.  Parent's bring children here on nice days to play, while they catch up with friends over a cup of coffee under the trees.  Seattle Parks has been making noise about the need to renovate this play area - which is exactly what is needed.  However, we have experienced delay after delay on this project with no clear and timely messaging form Seattle Parks.  This behavior from parks can been seen in the <a href ="/parks/lincoln-park-south" class="link-light">Lincoln Park South</a> project that has still not been completed after more than six years without a playground at all. </p>

      <p>Now four years and several "delays" later we Hiawatha Users must ask the question, is Seattle Parks being run in an efficient and effective manner?  How are our taxpayer dollars being spent?  How do we trust the word of Seattle Parks again?</p>

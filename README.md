# Where Is Our Playground‽

Welcome to the project. Here we try to hold Seattle Parks accountable for the numerous delays and promises that they fail to keep. If you have a park or playground in mind that Seattle Parks has been ignoring for too long, or that Parks is hoping you are not paying attention to, please create a pull request against this repo with a new page detailing the situation in your park. Use the page to “get the information out” to your community, demanding that Seattle Parks take notice!

## Join Us!
- If you want to help out, you can open up a new [Issue in GitHub](https://github.com/thewellington/whereisourplayground.org/issues).  Let us know who you are and what park page you want to help out with.

- If you have a new park you would like added to the site you can open a new [Issue in GitHub](https://github.com/thewellington/whereisourplayground.org/issues).

Once you get set up you can start with some basic park page maintenance.

- New parks go in `/_parks`
- you can use `/_parks/_template.html` to get started
- all images go in `/assets/images/<NAME OF PARK HERE>/` in order to get pulled into the LFS repository

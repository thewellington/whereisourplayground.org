# Where Is Our Playground‽

Welcome to the project. Here we try to hold Seattle Parks accountable for the numerous delays and promises that they fail to keep. If you have a park or playground in mind that Seattle Parks has been ignoring, or hoping you are not paying attention to, please create a pull request against this repo, with a new page detailing the situation in your park. Use the page to “get the information out” to your community, demanding that Seattle Parks take notice!

- New parks go in `/_parks`
- you can use `/_parks/_template.html` to get started
- all images go in `/assets/images/<NAME OF PARK HERE>/` in order to get pulled into the LFS repository
